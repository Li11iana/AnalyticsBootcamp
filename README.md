# Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp

## Introduction: 
Greetings! I'm thrilled to share my experience with the UC Davis Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, a program designed for practical proficiency in data analytics. Spanning 250 instructional hours and an additional 500 hours dedicated to project work, this bootcamp was all about hands-on learning and real-world application. 
I've compiled the projects executed and the tools used in *Modules* section, follow the project link to access it in full.

## Skills overview
* Command over essential tools: Intermediate Excel, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Tableau.
* Application of skills in real-world projects across diverse industries, showcasing adept data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
* Exploration of advanced topics including Big Data Analytics with Hadoop and in-depth Machine Learning, ensuring relevance to current industry trends.


## Modules and Projects

#### Module 1: Excel

[Link to project: Kickstarter_Analysis_Excel](https://github.com/Li11iana/Kickstarter_Analysis_Excel) 
 
This project analyzes historical data from Kickstarter campaigns to inform a successful crowdfunding strategy for the client's play "Fever" using Excel Pivot Tables. To determine the best strategy for the following factors were evaluated:
crowdfunding campaign, we evaluated 2 key factors: 
-	Launch date: To determine if the start date of the campaign had a significant effect on its outcome. 
-	Goals: The specific amount that is set to be collected could have an impact on the success rate of the campaign. 
  
Additional tools: To analyze the data, timestamp dates were transformed into a working date format for Excel using Unix Timestamps converter: https://www.epochconverter.com/

#### Module 2: Excel VBA

This project automates stock analysis for several green energy companies in Excel format. The goal is to provide finance advisors and their clients with a tool that facilitates the financial analysis of stocks, eliminating repetitive calculations and ensuring clear and consistent results by using Excel VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). After refactoring the code achieved a 12% reduction in calculated time, making it more efficient, especially for larger datasets.
In a study by Isabella Ferreira et al., it's acknowledged that refactoring, while reducing operational costs, can introduce new "bugs." However, careful planning and a clear goal can mitigate this risk.
