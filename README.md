## Modules and Projects

#### Module 1: Excel

This project analyzes historical data from Kickstarter campaigns to inform a successful crowdfunding strategy for Louise's play, "Fever" using Excel. To determine the best strategy for Louise's crowdfunding campaign, we evaluated 2 key factors: Launch date and monetary goal of the campaign.
Findings indicate May as the optimal launch month, December as less favorable, and Louise's $10,000 goal aligning with positive success trends.
