## Modules and Projects

#### Module 1: Excel

[Link to project: Kickstarter_Analysis_Excel](https://github.com/Li11iana/Kickstarter_Analysis_Excel) 
 
This project analyzes historical data from Kickstarter campaigns to inform a successful crowdfunding strategy for the client's play "Fever" using Excel Pivot Tables. To determine the best strategy for the following factors were evaluated:
crowdfunding campaign, we evaluated 2 key factors: 
-	Launch date: To determine if the start date of the campaign had a significant effect on its outcome. 
-	Goals: The specific amount that is set to be collected could have an impact on the success rate of the campaign. 
  
Additional tools: To analyze the data, timestamp dates were transformed into a working date format for Excel using Unix Timestamps converter: https://www.epochconverter.com/

#### Module 2: Excel VBA

[Link to project: Stock_Analysis_Excel VBA](https://github.com/Li11iana/Stock_analysis_VBA) 

This project automates stock analysis for several green energy companies in Excel format. The goal is to provide finance advisors and their clients with a tool that facilitates the financial analysis of stocks, eliminating repetitive calculations and ensuring clear and consistent results by using Excel VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). After refactoring the code achieved a 12% reduction in calculated time, making it more efficient, especially for larger datasets.
In a study by Isabella Ferreira et al., it's acknowledged that refactoring, while reducing operational costs, can introduce new "bugs." However, careful planning and a clear goal can mitigate this risk.

#### Module 3: Python

[Link to project: Election_Analysis_Python](https://github.com/Li11iana/Election_Analysis_Python) 


This project involves the analysis of election results for three counties: Denver, Arapahoe, and Jefferson. The data, stored in an Excel file, is processed using Python to automate the election result count and provide a visual summary of relevant data insights, facilitating the work of the election commission.

The Python script simplifies the election analysis and is adaptable for variable input, automatically iterating through data sources with different counties and candidates


#### Module 4: Python Pandas

[Link to project: School Analysis Python Pandas](https://github.com/Li11iana/PyCitySchools) 

This project employs Python Pandas to analyze and compare data from different schools in the city school district. By condensing the data, the project aims to reveal trends in budget and school performance, offering valuable insights for strategic decision-making in the education sector.

Pandas' tools offer a dynamic way to filter, summarize, and compare subsets, enabling both macro and micro-level analysis. Future analyses could include assessing the relationship between student population and budget allocation, providing further insights into the efficiency of budget utilization


#### Module 5: Python Matplotlib

[Link to project: Pyber Analysis Python Matplotlib](https://github.com/Li11iana/Pyber_Challenge) 

For this project, Python Pandas and Matplotlib were employed to analyze and visualize ride-sharing data collected by the PyBer app, enabling informed decision-making for the company. The focus was on understanding user behavior differences in rural, suburban, and urban communities to generate actionable business recommendations.

The analysis reveals that urban areas stand out as the primary revenue source for PyBer, underscoring the importance of sustained efforts in these densely populated regions. Simultaneously, untapped potential exists in suburban areas, and the higher average fare per driver in rural regions suggests an opportunity for strategic service expansion, ensuring PyBer's continued growth across diverse community types.

#### Module 6: Python APIs

[Link to project: Python APIs and World Wide Weather](https://github.com/Li11iana/World_Weather_Analysis) 

This project leverages the Google Maps and OpenWeatherMap databases to gather weather and lodging details for over 600 randomly generated cities globally. Through a simulated app, users receive travel recommendations based on desired weather conditions, aligning them with the real-time climate in the randomly selected cities. Once users choose preferred destinations, the system generates a travel route to assist in trip planning.
The integration of dynamically generated maps serves as a valuable visual aid, offering users an immersive and informative experience throughout their vacation planning journey.

#### Module 7: SQL

[Link to project: PostgreSQL Pewlett-Hackard Analysis](https://github.com/Li11iana/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis)

Pewlett-Hackard is confronted with an impending surge of employees nearing retirement, raising concerns about organizational preparedness. This project, conducted using SQL, aims to leverage company database data to furnish essential information for strategizing amidst this imminent staff transition. 
Utilizing PostgreSQL and pgAdmin, the primary goal of this project is to amalgamate all employee information into a unified database. Subsequently, the analysis seeks to extract details about retiring employees and potential candidates for mentorship.

#### Module 8: ETL
